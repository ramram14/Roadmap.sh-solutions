# ðŸ“• Personal Blog

## ðŸ“– Overview

This project builds a simple Personal Blog using Node.js and Express.js.

### Project Focused

This project is a backend server built using **Node.js** and **Express.js**, implementing essential features such as CRUD operations and basic authentication.

* **CRUD Operations** â€“ Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities.
* **Authentication** â€“ Implements a simple authentication mechanism using cookies (currently, user and admin data are hardcoded).
* **Templating with EJS** â€“ Uses EJS (Embedded JavaScript) to dynamically generate HTML on the server side.
* **Minimal Styling** â€“ While styling is not the primary focus, basic CSS has been included for foundational design elements.
